# Challenge Description
I decided to make a simple framer application, obviously with the help of my dear friend, you really think I would write that stuff?  

# Solve
The frame is in black and white which suggest binary, taking in the binary from the top-left from the picture in a clockwise direction yields the flag.  
Black being a 0 and white being a 1.  

# Flag
pascalCTF{Wh41t_wh0_4r3_7h0s3_9uy5???}
