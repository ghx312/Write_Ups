# Challenge Details
Challenge Name: Artifact 15 Bitwise  
Category: Reverse Engineering  
Author: cewau  

# Challenge Description
Exploration on number systems and bitwise and bytewise operations.

# Solve
First function is a XOR Function, you can reverse the sha256 of the verify function using a precomputed database.  
Second function can be bruteforce or reverse engineered by changing rol to ror, making a ror function that takes the right most bit and rotates to the left.  
A bruteforce is possible 
This will give you your flag
