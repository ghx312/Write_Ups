# Challenge Details
Challenge Name: Command Injection  
Category: Web Exploitation  
Author: Iscara  

# Challenge Description
In web security, a majority of vulnerabilities stem from untrusted user input being used improperly. A command injection occurs when user input is placed into shell commands without sufficient input validation, allowing a malicious user to run arbitrary commands on the server.

Let's try! Your goal here is to be able to execute and read the output of arbitrary commands on the server.
