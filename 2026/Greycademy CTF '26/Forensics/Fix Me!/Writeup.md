# Challenge Description
Why this PNG file not opening :/

# Solve
The PNG is not recognise in windows image viewer, this means that the file header is not working correctly, checking its bytes in hexedit we can see that the header bytes are replaces with GREYHATS instead of the usualy png header bytes, changing that gives us the corrected png and the flag.  

# Flag
grey{sign4tur3s_c001}
